# Legacy

(Early Access coming in December to the Meta Quest Store) 

Legacy is a Meta Incubation Program funded mixed reality gamified cultural learning application developed for the Meta Quest. Legacy aims to redefine cultural learning and exploration. Picture yourself being transported to vibrant cultures around the world-whether itâ€™s learning to mastering the art of dumpling making in China, or learning to play the traditional Tabla drums in India, all while talking to true AI mentors packed with knowledge from their corresponding culture, all from the comfort of your own room! ðŸª˜ðŸ¥Ÿ
